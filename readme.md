#Neon Defence
Neon Defence is an exciting tower defense game where your objective is to protect the Sun of Neon City from various types of enemies. Build and strategically place different types of turrets to fend off waves of incoming enemies and prevent them from reaching the Sun. If enemies manage to reach the Sun, you will lose a life. Be careful, as losing three lives will result in a game over.

##Turrets
Neon Defence features four unique types of turrets that you can utilize to defend against the enemy waves:

###AutoTurret: This turret automatically fires at enemies within its range. It provides a consistent stream of damage to keep the enemy at bay.

###ShotGunTurret: The ShotGunTurret unleashes a powerful shotgun blast that damages multiple enemies in a cone-shaped area. It's great for dealing with groups of weaker enemies.

###LaserTurret: The LaserTurret emits a high-intensity laser beam that can cut through enemies, dealing continuous damage to a single target. It's effective against tougher foes.

###HumanControlledTurret: The HumanControlledTurret allows you, the player, to take control and manually aim and shoot at enemies. Use your skills to accurately eliminate threats and protect the Sun.

##Enemies
Neon Defence throws various enemies at you throughout the game. Here are some of the enemy types you will encounter:

###Basic Robot: These are the most common enemies you'll face. They have moderate health and deal low damage.

###Reinforced Robot: Reinforced robots are tougher than the basic ones, requiring more hits to defeat. Be prepared for a longer fight.

###Mechanic Spider: These agile enemies can crawl over obstacles and move quickly towards the Sun. Watch out for their speed.

###Drone: Drones are aerial enemies that fly above the ground defenses. You'll need to use turrets capable of hitting airborne targets to deal with them.

###Boss: Boss enemies are formidable adversaries that possess high health and deal significant damage. They pose a real threat to the Sun and require careful planning to defeat.

##How to Play
###Build Turrets: Use the in-game resources to construct and place turrets strategically. Experiment with different turret combinations to find the most effective defense against each enemy type.

###Upgrade Turrets: As you progress, you'll earn resources that can be used to upgrade your turrets. Enhance their firepower, range, and special abilities to improve their effectiveness against the increasingly challenging enemies.

###Monitor Resources: Keep an eye on your available resources, as they are limited. Spend them wisely to optimize your defense strategy.

###Defend the Sun: Your primary objective is to protect the Sun from enemy incursions. Ensure that no enemy reaches the Sun by eliminating them with your turrets.

###Lives and Game Over: You start with three lives. If an enemy reaches the Sun, you lose a life. Losing all three lives will result in a game over. Strive to maintain a strong defense and keep the Sun safe.
