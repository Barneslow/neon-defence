#Neon Defence:
Neon Defence is an exciting tower defense game where your objective is to protect the Sun of Neon City from various types of enemies. Build and strategically place different types of turrets to fend off waves of incoming enemies and prevent them from reaching the Sun. If enemies manage to reach the Sun, you will lose a life. Be careful, as losing three lives will result in a game over.

##Turrets:
Neon Defence features four unique types of turrets that you can utilize to defend against the enemy waves, and turrets level up after killing enough enemies:

###AutoTurret:

##How to Play
###Build Turrets: 
Use the in-game resources to construct and place turrets strategically. Experiment with different turret combinations to find the most effective defense against each enemy type.

###Upgrade Turrets: 
As you progress, you'll earn resources that can be used to upgrade your turrets. Enhance their firepower, range, and special abilities to improve their effectiveness against the increasingly challenging enemies.

###Monitor Resources: 
Keep an eye on your available resources, as they are limited. Spend them wisely to optimize your defense strategy.

###Defend the Sun: 
Your primary objective is to protect the Sun from enemy incursions. Ensure that no enemy reaches the Sun by eliminating them with your turrets.

###Lives and Game Over: 
You start with three lives. If an enemy reaches the Sun, you lose a life. Losing all three lives will result in a game over. Strive to maintain a strong defense and keep the Sun safe.
